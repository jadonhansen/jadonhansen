### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Below are a few of my projects associated with WeThinkCode_ and some personal projects I have worked on.
Some of my personal project repositories are private...for obvious reason :) But if you would like to view something, let me know!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my mobile Weather application called Weatherly! [Google Play Store - Weatherly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jadonhansen.weatherly)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, React Native and Expo.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jadon-hansen-879358193/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: My profile image is an ode to my favourite movie of all time, Surf's Up!
