### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Below are a few of my projects associated with WeThinkCode_ and some personal projects I have worked on.
Some of my personal project repositories are private...for obvious reason :) But if you would like to view something, let me know!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently maintaining three React Native mobile apps - DigiWallet, Weatherly and Local Hustle. [See my apps portfolio](https://apps.jadonhansen.com/) for the app store links.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vite with Vue.js.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jadon-hansen-879358193/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: My profile image is an ode to my favourite movie of all time, Surf's Up!
